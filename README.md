# README

Some shell scripts I've written to help with managing a Slackware Linux installation.

## System Update

Typically do the following in order to update a system:

1. update-noprompts.sh
2. mkinitrd_post_upgrade-all.sh
3. check-reboot-state.sh

## Package Management

To find out which package a command belongs to, use the pkg_locator.sh script.
